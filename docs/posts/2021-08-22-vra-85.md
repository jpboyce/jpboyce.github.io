# vRealize Automation 8.5

A few days ago, VMware released an update for vRealize Automation (vRA). The list of improvements seems relatively minor this time, as detailed in the [Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Automation/8.5/rn/vmware-vrealize-automation-85-release-notes.html). It seems the biggest change was mentioned in the [blog announcement](https://blogs.vmware.com/management/2021/08/whats-new-with-vrealize-automation-technical-overview.html) for this release, where vRA is moving to monthly releases. Since these updates are feature focused, that potentially means a more frequent update cycle for administrators. Hopefully this means the update process will become smoother going forward. From personal experience, itâ€™s been a bit hit and miss.
